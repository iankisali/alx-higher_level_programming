# ALX HIGHER-LEVEL PROGRAMMING

This is a repo contains directories of projects on higher-level programming carried out during Software Engineering studies at ```ALX SE``` and ```Holberton School```.

In the projects in this repo, I'm learning Python Programming Language and using the skills acquired to solve tasks that are in this repo.
